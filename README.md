# OSM Road Editor

This tool focuses on road data in the OSM file. You can read the road data from a OSM file, edit it, and save it to a OSM file. Other objects such as building are ignored. Also, only a subset of attributes, road type, #lanes, one way, are supported. The main purpose of this tool is to create a clean and planar graph structure of roads so that the resultant roads can be used to easily generate a 3D city model using a procedural modeling even though the procedural modeling engine is not integrated yet.
