# OSMEditor

This tool focuses on road data in the OSM file. You can read the road data from a OSM file, edit it, and save it to a OSM file.

Limitations:
- When you save the roads to a OSM file, the IDs are not preserved from the original OSM file. They are unique only in the newly created OSM file.
